The data are not perfect in the staging from XML-based source system.
Sometimes, there are different attributes for the same uniqueid in one daily batch.
DBT approach does not eliminate such records because they are in 1 batch.
There is no proper way to understand which record is correct in an automated mode.
I select just one, latest transaction record per batch: the max transactionsequencenumber
